Project Plan

I am including this text file to show my initial planning before starting the project. I figured it will also be useful for me as I may be jumping on and off of this project over the next couple of day.

Pre code:
1. Read through assignment
2. Decide on unit testing tool (probably Jest)
3. Determine what will serve the page locally (probably node, but maybe flask)
4. Decide if app will be SPA or MPA
5. Determine if Vue.js framework is benefitial or not
6. Get idea of how I want the app to look
Post plan:
7. Serve project locally
8. Build out basic HTML with styles for structure
9. Add functionality
10. Beautify project

Things to remember throughout:
1. TDD with unit tests
2. Functional (as much as possible)
3. Mobile first
4. Can I make operations async?

If there is enough time:
1. Look into more robust testing (Integration testing)
2. Directions for deploying to distributed cloud infrastructure
