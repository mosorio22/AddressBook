Project Plan

I am including this text file to show my initial planning before starting the project. I figured it will also be useful for me as I may be jumping on and off of this project over the next couple of day.

Pre code:
1. Read through assignment - check
2. Decide on unit testing tool (probably Jest) - Jest
3. Determine what will serve the page locally (probably node, but maybe flask) - node
4. Decide if app will be SPA or MPA - SPA(?)
5. Determine if Vue.js framework is beneficial or not - no.
- debated scalability vs it probably being overkill for the project. Plus I'd like to show more foundational js skills.
6. Get idea of how I want the app to look 
- main page - display names bulleted like in a notebook. Address would be included to the right of the name.
- details page - have user's image with name under. Include phone number under that.
Post plan:
7. Serve project locally
8. Build out basic HTML with styles for structure
9. Add functionality
10. Beautify project

Things to remember throughout:
1. TDD with unit tests
2. Functional (as much as possible)
3. Mobile first
4. Can I make operations async?

If there is enough time:
1. Look into more robust testing (Integration testing)
2. Directions for deploying to distributed cloud infrastructure
